# App

## Requirements

This is quiet a length process so bare with me as I try to explain it all

1. Make sure node.js is installed globally on your system (this needs to be >version 12)
2. The easiest way to build react native apps is with the Expo CLI which is what we will use (for now). You can install this with `npm install -g expo-cli` (this might take a while and show some warning)
3. Download the expo client app from the App store or Play store onto your mobile phone (this is for testing our app on your own device)

## Run

`npm install`
`npm start`

either scan the QR code with the expo client app you installed on your phone, or use a native emulator (such as android studio) to preview on your computer
