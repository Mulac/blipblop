This is just a demonstration of scraping with Go.  It simply fetches the Job Titles of all the positions in Leeds and prints them to stdout.

### Setup
1. Make sure Go is installed (it's super easy)
2. `go run main.go`

If you haven't used Go before, welcome to the simple life...

### To use a different scraper
`SCRAPER=apify go run main.go`

### Contributing
Make your change in a feature branch i.e. `scraper/feature/apify-concurrent`

Make sure you're code is readable and you have `go fmt` your files before pushing.

Then submit a PR which must get approval from at least one other dev.
